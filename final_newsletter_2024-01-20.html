<p>Taylor Swift is a total boss when it comes to taking risks, and her latest move is paying off big time. Despite "Cruel Summer" being released a few years ago, it's currently making history on Billboard's radio chart. This banger has been holding on to the number one spot on the Adult Pop Airplay chart for an epic 19 weeks, beating out some other iconic tracks. If she can keep it up for another month, she'll be tied for second place on the all-time rankings. But let's be real, we wouldn't be surprised if she ends up taking the crown. 'Cause we all know, when it comes to music, Taylor stays slayin'.</p>

<p>Okay, so picture this: Taylor Swift rocking a custom puffer jacket at a Chiefs' playoff game. Yeah, we all know Queen Tay has killer style, but this jacket caught everyone's attention and got us all talking. Turns out the designer, Kristin Juszczyk, is now in talks with the NFL to make her jackets official merchandise. And get this, the league is noticing a big increase in fan interest, especially from the ladies. Juszczyk isn't even selling her jackets yet, but she's already got a massive fan base, with almost 400K Insta followers (that's more than some NFL players, just saying). But the best part? Her jackets have been spotted on some pretty cool people, like Brittany Mahomes and Taylor Lautner (swoon). And she's not just about the celebs, she's also designed game day outfits for NFL players and their wives, like Simone Biles. So yeah, this designer</p>
